// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Battle Royale all players are against each other, as in Last Man Standing.
// There is no respawn (future: maybe allow a limited number of respawns?).
// All players start with an empty pistol and a knife.
// At random intervals care packages are dropped, up to a maximum of four.
// If there are packages already on the map they count towards the maximum allowed.
// The number of packages dropped depends on how many players remain, minimum of one.
// The packages may contain an unknown primary, attachment, perk, explosive, or armor.
// Any new primary replaces the old one. The old attachment is lost.
// Players may have three perks max. On capturing a fourth the oldest of the three is removed.
// There are rotating minefields. A timer is included to give players an opportunity to run.
// There is an 'elminiation' timer. If no player makes a kill a random player is suicided.
// The last man standing wins.
