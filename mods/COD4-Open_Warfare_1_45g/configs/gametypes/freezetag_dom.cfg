// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Freeze Tag Domination two teams fight each other to control three flags
//
// The difference between Freeze Tag Domination and Team Deathmatch is that in Freeze Tag
// players will be frozen when killed and their teammates need to unfreeze
// them to come back into the game.
// However unlike Freeze Tag, freezing all of the enemy will not win the game.
// Therefore auto-unfreeze is required.
//
// To unfreeze players their teammates will need to get close to them or point to
// them and press the USE key to give them health again (body temperature). Once the
// player reaches the maximum health he/she will be unfrozen.
//
// Players on both teams need to capture the flags around the map to gain points.
// If one team controls all the flags they will received extra bonus points 
// according to the amount of flags in the map.
