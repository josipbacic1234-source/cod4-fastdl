A few notes about config files:

When a server is ready and live it is recommended the main "server.cfg" name be changed to something more random such as "xdf3rjikIhjWfDAw.cfg"
to make it impossible to guess so it cannot be downloaded.

Do the same for configs with important data such as guids.

Keep rcon passwords in the startup line.
